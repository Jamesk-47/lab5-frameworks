UI Frameworks in Practice â€“ Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js
Group member: Esau Ngoma 2021453600

TOOLS USED
This lab provided an excellent opportunity to explore different front-end frameworks and libraries, each offering its own styling and interactivity. 
Bootstrap: Helped me to quickly build a responsive page layout using the pre-built components, which is great for rapid development when you need standard UI elements but it was less flexible for custom designs.
  
Tailwind CSS: With its utility-first approach, it gave me more control over the design without having to write custom CSS. Tailwind's responsive design system allowed me to easily adapt the layout for different screen sizes.

React: made adding dynamic features to the page much easier with its component-based structure and state management using hooks like `useState()`. It helped tocreate interactive features and the experience helped me solidify my understanding of how state and props work in React.
